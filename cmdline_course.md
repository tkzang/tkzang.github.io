# Command-Line Course

## Introduction
This course aims to provide a gentle introduction to the UNIX command line environment. The command line is a useful tool for language technology in todayâ€™s fast changing world, where many libraries and software are being published and updated rapidly, therefore
providing only the most basic command line interfaces. Moreover, command line is a very efficient interface, which can substantially improve the speed of development when used properly.

### Week 1: Introduction to the Command Line
In this week we set up our command-line environement and learned basic commands. To list just a few examples: 
- `ls`: list the contents of the current directory; 
- `cd`: change directory; 
- `wget`: download contents from the internet;
- `nano` : edit text.


### - Week 2: Navigating a UNIX system
In this week we continued to learn more about the UNIX system, such as `cp` for copying files, `mv` for moving files and `rm` to remove files. We also learned about remote servers.
```
ssh <username>@puhti.csc.fi
```
This is the command to connect to the puhti server.

### - Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing
This week was about using text processing tools in UNIX. First we learned about character encodings. Then we learned some useful commands of text processing, for example:
```
cat file.txt| tr '[:space][:punct:] ' '\n' | sort -f | uniq -i > word_list.txt
```
This command will generate a word list of file.txt.
We also learned simple regular expressions and the `egrep` command which is for searching for contents in text files.\

### - Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing
This week we learned more about text processing using UNIX commands. We learned to combine simple commands into more complex command pipelines. First we learned the `sed` command which is for finding and replacing strings, and also for insertion, deletion, search, and other common requirements. Then we learned, for example, creating a sentence-per-line file by using this command:
```
cat file.txt | dos2unix | sed 's/^$/^#/' | tr '\n' ' ' | sed -E 's/([.?!]) ([A-Z])/\1#\2/g' | tr '#' '\n' | sed 's/^ #//' | sed 's/ *$//' | grep -v "^$" > sentence_per_line.txt
```

### - Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files
This week we learned about combining commands in scripts. For example, we wrote a script to generate frequence lists:
```

#! /bin/bash
if [ $# -ne 2 ]
then
	echo "error"
	echo "$0 input_text_file output_freq_file
	exit 1
fi

cat $1|
dos2unix|
tr -s "[:space:]" "\n"|
tr -d "[:punct"]" |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -nr > $2
```
We would also use `chmod u+x` to obtain access to this script.
We also learned about setting environment variables, as well as the `source` command to source .bashrc file.

### - Week 6: Installing and Running Programs
This week we first learned about intalling programs. The `sudo apt-get` is used for installing software and `pip install` for installing python packages. We also learned why it's important to create a virtual enviroment for each project and to use `python3 -m venv venv` to create a venv. 
Finally, we learned `make` command, for example:
```
%.freq: %.no_md.txt
    bin/freqlist.sh $< $@
```
This is a make rule which has a target %.freq and dependency %.no_md.txt. We could also use `make clean` command to remove all the files that `make` generated. 

### - Week 7: Version Control
This week we learned version control using Git and Github. We also learned how to use `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` commands to add, commit and push changes to the Github repository. We also learned about creating and merging branches. Lastly, we learned to build our own webpages using Github.
